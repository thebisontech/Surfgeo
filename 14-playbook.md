# GEO Playbook

This playbook provides a framework for auditing and creating content that performs well in search engines and is more likely to be cited by AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.).

The goal is to produce content that is trustworthy, easy to quote, and straightforward for both humans and machines to understand.

***

## 1. Core Principle: Be the Source of Truth

* Lead with the answer. Place the main conclusion at the start.
* Support every claim with numbers, comparisons, or evidence.
* Ensure each section can stand alone as a 1–2 sentence quote.

**Example**

* Weak: “Memory foam mattresses are very comfortable.”
* Strong: “Memory foam mattresses reduce back pain by 30% compared to spring mattresses (study of 500 participants, 2024).”

***

## 2. Page Structure Blueprint

When writing or reviewing content, confirm that it follows this order:

1. **Title (H1)**
   * Use the exact user question or keyword.
   * Example: _Best ergonomic office chairs for small spaces (2025)._
2. **Quick Answer (TL;DR)**
   * 1–3 sentences summarizing the conclusion with a fact or metric.
   * Example: _“The best ergonomic chair for small apartments in 2025 is Herman Miller Sayl — compact and reduces back strain by 25%.”_
3. **Key Takeaways (Snippets)**
   * Three to five short bullet points with facts or data.
4. **Table of Contents**
   * A navigational overview.
5. **Body Content**
   * Split into small sections (see Micro-Block Rule).
6. **Evidence/Proof Section**
   * Describe methods, tools, or data sources.
7. **Author Box**
   * Show expertise, background, and credibility.
8. **Update Log**
   * Display last updated date and version history.
9. **FAQ Section**
   * Short, one-line answers to related questions.

***

## 3. Micro-Block Rule

Each section should follow this four-part structure:

1. **Subheading (Question/Claim)**
   * Example: _Does a standing desk improve productivity?_
2. **One-line Answer (with metric)**
   * Example: _Yes — standing desks increase productivity by 12% compared to seated workstations (2024 Harvard Study)._
3. **Evidence (How We Know)**
   * Example: _Study tracked 300 employees over six months using ergonomics sensors._
4. **Why It Matters**
   * Example: _Higher productivity means more focus and fewer health issues._

(Optionally include a chart, table, or downloadable dataset.)

***

## 4. Writing Rules

* Every claim must include a number or measurable fact.
* Keep sentences concise (preferably under 20 words).
* Avoid hedging language (“might help” → “helps by 25%”).
* Use comparisons to clarify significance.
* Place the most important information first.

***

## 5. Evidence and Proof

To build credibility, include:

* Methodology: how the data was collected or tested.
* Sample size: number of participants or data points.
* Tools or sources: surveys, analytics, or studies.
* Raw data: links to spreadsheets or datasets.
* Visual proof: screenshots, graphs, or tables with captions.

**Example Caption**

“Figure: Sleep quality improved by 18% with memory foam compared to spring beds (500 participants, 2024 clinical trial).”

***

## 6. Visuals

* Each important claim should have a chart, table, or image.
* Captions must contain facts, numbers, and context.
* File names should be descriptive and machine-readable (e.g., _mattress\_sleepstudy\_v1.jpg_).

***

## 7. Content Types and Applications

* **News/Updates**
  * Begin with the date and main fact.
  * Include source links.
* **How-To Guides**
  * Start with the outcome.
  * Provide step-by-step instructions with time estimates.
* **Listicles (“Best of”)**
  * Each item should have a fact/metric and a rationale.
* **Research/Reports**
  * Publish the dataset and explain methodology.

***

## 8. Author and Trust Signals

Every article should include:

* Author name and role.
* Credentials or experience that establish expertise.
* Editorial policy (disclosure of sponsorships or testing practices).

This builds credibility for both human readers and AI systems.

***

## 9. Updating and Versioning

* Clearly display “Last Updated: \[Date]” at the top of the page.
* Maintain a visible changelog or version notes.
* Fresh content is considered more trustworthy.

***

## 10. GEO Content Audit Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

* [ ] Title matches the user’s search question.
* [ ] First 25 words contain the main answer and a metric.
* [ ] Each claim follows the Micro-Block Rule.
* [ ] Claims use numbers instead of vague adjectives.
* [ ] Visuals are included with captions and metrics.
* [ ] Author box is present.
* [ ] Last updated date is visible.
* [ ] FAQ section is included.

If any item is missing, revise before publishing.

## 11. GEO Fast Wins

If time is limited, prioritize the following five actions:

1. Place the main answer and metric in the title and introduction.
2. Ensure each key claim includes at least one number.
3. Provide a clear proof or methodology.
4. Include an author box with credibility signals.
5. Keep content updated and visibly timestamped.
