# What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) â€” short conceptual primer

## What Is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

Generative Engine Optimization represents a fundamental shift in how brands approach digital visibility.

Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on ranking in search engine results pages, **GEO is about ensuring your brand appears naturally and prominently in AI-generated responses**.

When users ask ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or other LLMs questions about your industry, products, or services, GEO determines:
- Whether your brand is mentioned.
- How it is positioned.
- With what level of authority.

## Why GEO Matters

The importance of GEO stems from a simple reality: increasingly, **users aren't clicking through to websites from search results**.
Instead, they're getting complete answers directly from AI assistants.

If your brand isn't mentioned in these responses, you're invisible to a growing segment of your audience.

## How GEO Bridges the Gap

GEO provides the **data, insights, and strategies** needed to optimize for this new paradigm by:
- Tracking AI-generated brand mentions.
- Explaining competitive positioning.
- Supplying strategies to appear with authority in AI answers.
