# Core Concepts & Glossary

## What is GEO or Generative Engine Optimisation?

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** is the evolution of SEO. If SEO was about getting ranked on search engine result pages, GEO is about **getting cited, mentioned, and recommended by AI agents** in real time.

Here’s why it matters:

* **AI is the new front page of the internet** — People no longer ask “What’s the best X?” to Google, they ask ChatGPT or Perplexity.
* **Results aren’t 10 blue links anymore** — They’re a single answer, a conversation, or a curated list that **decides for the user.**
* **Visibility compounds faster** — If you’re the brand or expert that AI repeatedly cites, you don’t just get clicks — you get **trust, relevance, and market share.**

GEO is not about gaming the algorithm — it’s about **shaping the narrative layer of the internet.** It means understanding how large language models pull knowledge, how they reference brands, and how you can systematically position yourself so that when a customer asks, “Which tool should I use?”, **your name is the one the AI says out loud.**

With SurfGEO, GEO becomes not just an abstract idea but a **measurable, actionable strategy.**
