# Data model

Understanding how Surfgeo defines and tracks key data elements ensures accurate interpretation of your metrics.

**Mention**

* Any time your brand, product, or approved alias appears in an LLM’s answer, Surfgeo records it as a mention.
* Mentions are tracked with added context — including sentiment, tone, and placement — so you know not just that you appeared, but _how_ you were portrayed.

**Response**

* A response is the full answer an LLM provides to a user’s query, which may include multiple mentions and citations.
* Capturing the entire response helps you see the full narrative, how your brand is positioned, and what competitors are mentioned alongside you.

**Citation**

* A citation occurs when an LLM attributes part of its answer to a specific source, such as a website, publisher, or domain.
* Tracking citations shows which sources the model trusts, helping you measure whether your own content is recognized as authoritative.

**Prompt**

* A prompt is the original user query that triggers an LLM response, representing real demand signals from potential customers.
* Surfgeo categorizes prompts by intent, topic, and funnel stage, allowing you to analyze user needs and align your strategy with buyer journeys.
