# Data model: what "mention", "response", "citation", "prompt" mean

Understanding how Surfgeo defines and tracks key data elements ensures accurate interpretation of your metrics.

**Mention**: Any instance where your brand name, product, or designated aliases appear in an LLM response. Mentions are tracked with context to determine sentiment and prominence.

**Response**: The complete answer generated by an LLM to a user prompt. A single response may contain multiple brand mentions and citations.

**Citation**: When an LLM explicitly references or links to a source.

**Prompt**: The user's question or request that triggers an LLM response. Prompts are categorized by intent, topic, and funnel stage for strategic analysis.
