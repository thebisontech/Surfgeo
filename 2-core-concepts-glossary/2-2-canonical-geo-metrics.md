# Canonical GEO metrics

## Understanding Surfgeo's Metrics

Understanding Surfgeo's metrics is crucial for measuring and improving your GEO performance.
Each metric serves a specific purpose in your optimization strategy.

## LLM Mention Rate

- **Formula:**
Brand Mentions in LLM Responses ÷ Total Prompts Tracked × 100

- **Example Calculation:**
If your brand appears in 150 responses out of 3,000 tracked prompts, your mention rate is **5.0%**.

- **Why It Matters:**
  - The mention rate is your fundamental visibility metric.
  - It tells you what percentage of relevant conversations include your brand.
  - A low mention rate indicates opportunity for improvement.
  - A high rate suggests strong brand presence.
  - Track this metric over time to measure the impact of your GEO efforts.
  - Industry leaders typically maintain mention rates between **8–15%** for their core topics.

## Share of Voice (SOV)

- **Formula:**
Brand Mentions ÷ Total Competitor Mentions × 100

- **Example Calculation:**
If your brand has 200 mentions and all competitors combined have 1,000 mentions, your SOV is **20%**.

- **Why It Matters:**
  - Share of Voice measures your relative dominance in the competitive landscape.
  - Unlike mention rate, which measures absolute visibility, SOV tells you how you stack up against competitors.
  - A rising SOV indicates you're gaining ground, even if overall industry mentions are declining.
  - This metric is particularly valuable for **board reporting and competitive benchmarking**.

## Brand Rank

Brand Rank represents your position relative to competitors based on visibility metrics.
The calculation considers multiple factors:

- **Primary Ranking Factor:**
Overall visibility percentage across all tracked prompts.

- **Tie-Breaking Rules:**
1. Higher absolute mention count takes precedence.
2. More consistent performance across different LLM models.
3. Historical performance trend (improving brands ranked higher).

- **Per-Model vs Aggregate Ranking:**
  - Surfgeo calculates both **model-specific rankings** (how you perform on ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini).
  - And **aggregate rankings** across all models.
  - This dual approach helps identify **model-specific optimization opportunities**.
