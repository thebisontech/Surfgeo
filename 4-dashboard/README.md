## Dashboard KPI Cards

The dashboard presents four primary KPI cards that provide an **at-a-glance view** of your GEO performance. Each card is designed to answer a **critical business question**.

## Mention Rate Card

* **What it shows:** Mention rate shows how often your brand appears in AI responses compared to the total number of responses tracked. It is your most basic measure of presence. If lots of people ask questions and AI models rarely mention your brand, your mention rate will be low. If your brand keeps coming up across answers, your mention rate will be high.
* **Formula:** (Your Brand Mentions ÷ Total Responses) × 100
* **Example Display:** "2.4% (312 of 13,000)"
* **Hover Insight:** Detailed breakdown by **LLM model**.

## Share in Industry Card

* **What it shows:** Share in Industry shows how big your brand’s share of mentions is compared to everyone else in your industry. Instead of only asking “Am I visible?”, this metric asks “Am I more visible than my competitors?” It’s your market share of visibility in AI-generated answers.
* **Formula:** (Your Brand Mentions ÷ All Brand Mentions in Industry) × 100
* **Example:** A **15% share** means you own **15% of all brand mentions** in your tracked industry.

## Brand Rank Card

* **What it represents:** Brand Rank tells you your exact position compared to other brands. It’s like a leaderboard for visibility. Instead of just showing a percentage, it gives you a rank — for example, 3rd out of 12 brands.
* **Display Format:** "#3 of 12" → meaning you rank third among twelve tracked brands.
