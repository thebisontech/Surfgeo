# Industry Ranking Table and Top Prompts widget — how sorting and exports work

The **Industry Ranking Table** provides detailed **competitive intelligence at a glance**.
It’s designed to show exactly how your brand compares to competitors in terms of mentions, visibility, and ranking. Instead of looking at numbers in isolation, the table brings everything together in one view so you can benchmark your performance side by side.

The Top Prompts widget works in a similar way but focuses on the specific queries driving visibility. Both tools are built to help you sort, filter, and export data for deeper analysis or reporting.

## Table Columns

- **Position**
  - Shows the **current rank** of each brand.
  - This makes it easy to see not just where a brand stands today, but also who is gaining or losing ground.

- **Brand**
  - Displays the **company name** for each competitor being tracked.
  - Each name often links to a more detailed breakdown page, letting you drill into a single brand’s performance without leaving the dashboard.

- **Mentions**
  - The **absolute mention count** for the selected period.
  - This number shows the raw volume of times a brand was mentioned in AI responses.
  - Useful for understanding raw visibility volume.

- **Visibility %**
  - The **percentage of responses** that mention the brand, calculated as (Brand Mentions ÷ Total Responses) × 100.
  - This is the most important metric for benchmarking because it normalizes results, making it easy to compare across brands of different sizes.
  - This is the **default sort column**.
