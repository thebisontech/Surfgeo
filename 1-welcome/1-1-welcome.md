# Welcome to Surfgeo: what it is, who it's for

## Welcome to Surfgeo

Surfgeo is the industry's first comprehensive tracking, analytics, and optimization platform dedicated to **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.

As Large Language Models increasingly shape how users discover information and make purchasing decisions, Surfgeo provides the intelligence and tools you need to ensure your brand appears prominently in AI-generated responses.

Think of Surfgeo as your command center for the AI search revolution.

Just as SEO transformed how brands approached traditional search engines, GEO represents the next frontier in digital visibility.

Our platform:
- Tracks how often your brand appears in AI responses across major LLMs.
- Analyzes your competitive positioning.
- Provides actionable insights to optimise for your AI search presence.

## Who Is Surfgeo For?

Surfgeo serves three primary audiences who understand that the future of search is conversational and AI-driven:

- **Mid-to-Large B2B SaaS Companies**
  - Rely on high-value keywords and category authority for pipeline generation.
  - Use Surfgeo to benchmark LLM visibility against direct competitors.
  - Discover underperforming pages, fix technical gaps, and execute GEO-driven content campaigns.

- **Enterprise Consumer Brands**
  - Recognize that products are increasingly recommended or omitted in AI answers that shape purchase decisions.
  - Use Surfgeo to monitor AI-generated product recommendations.
  - Ensure factual accuracy and optimize product/category pages for LLM inclusion.

- **Digital Agencies & Consultancies**
  - Need to offer cutting-edge services beyond traditional SEO and PPC.
  - Leverage Surfgeo to audit clients, prepare visibility reports, and deploy LLM-optimized campaigns that position them as innovative advisors.

## Why Surfgeo Matters

No marketer or growth lead can currently see how their brand appears in AI-generated answers â€” let alone diagnose why and fix it systematically.

Surfgeo solves this critical visibility gap by providing three core capabilities:
- **Track** brand mentions and rankings across major LLMs.
- **Analyze** performance through weighted compatibility audits that reveal why certain pages don't make it into LLM answers.
- **Optimize** with URL-level fixes and content strategy recommendations tailored for LLM citation logic.
