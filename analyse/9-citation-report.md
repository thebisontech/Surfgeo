# Citation Report

The **Citation report page** shows how often different domains are cited in AI-generated responses.\
It reveals the evolving landscape of **domain authority**, giving you **critical intelligence** for shaping your **content strategy**.

***

## Understanding the Formula

* **Source Usage %**
  * **Formula:**\
    &#xNAN;_(Number of responses citing domain ÷ Total responses analyzed) × 100_
  * **Example:**\
    If _wikipedia.org_ appears in **500 out of 1,000 responses**, its usage rate is **50%**.
  * This percentage tells you how widely a domain is used across AI responses.
* **Average Citations per Answer**
  * **Formula:**\
    &#xNAN;_&#x54;otal citations of domain ÷ Number of responses citing it_
  * **Example:**\
    If a domain is cited **3 times each** in 100 responses, the average is **3.0 citations per answer**.
  * This shows how heavily an answer relies on a source once it is cited.

## Interpreting Usage Patterns

Different usage patterns reveal different **types of domain authority**:

* **High Usage + High Average Citations**
  * Indicates a **cornerstone authority**.
  * These domains are both **frequently referenced** and **deeply relied upon**.
* **High Usage + Low Average Citations**
  * Suggests **broad but shallow influence**.
  * Often applies to **general reference sites** that are cited briefly but widely.
* **Low Usage + High Average Citations**
  * Reflects **niche expertise domains**.
  * These aren’t mentioned often, but when they are, they provide **deep, valuable information**.

Understanding these patterns helps you decide **what type of authority** to build for your own domain.

## Temporal Analysis

The **time-series view** of source usage shows how domain influence changes over time.\
It helps identify important market dynamics:

* **Emerging sources** gaining rapid adoption → may indicate **new competitors** or **partnership opportunities**.
* **Declining sources** losing citations → could signal **algorithm changes** or **content freshness issues**.
* **Seasonal patterns** → often tied to **industry events** or **buying cycles**.
* **Sudden spikes/drops** → usually linked to **algorithm updates** or **major content changes**.

You can also **set alerts** to track significant changes in source usage that affect your domain or key competitors.
