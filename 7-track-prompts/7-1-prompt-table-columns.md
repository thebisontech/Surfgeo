The **prompt tracking system** gives you detailed visibility into the **questions users are asking** and how your brand performs for each one.
This helps you understand which prompts are driving visibility, where competitors are winning, and how to optimize for better results.

### Core Table Structure

- **Prompt Column**
    - Displays the exact **user query text** that triggered an AI response.
    - Uses **intelligent highlighting** to mark important keywords, brand names, or entities within the query.
    - This makes it easier to quickly scan and identify what the query is really about without reading the entire text word for word.
- **Visibility Column**
    - Displays your brand’s **mention percentage** for that specific prompt.
    - Formula: (Your Brand Mentions for Prompt ÷ Total Brand Mentions for Prompt) × 100
- **Top Competitor**
    - Displays the competitor with the highest visibility for that specific prompt.

    - This allows quick benchmarking to see who you’re up against on a query-by-query basis.

    - Knowing the top competitor helps you decide where to focus optimization efforts.
- **Tags**
    - Each prompt can have tags assigned for better organization and filtering.

    - Tags might represent intent (e.g., informational, transactional), topic clusters (e.g., cloud security), or custom labels defined by your team.

    - Tags help group prompts together so you can analyze them in batches rather than one by one.
- **Funnel Stage**
    - Every prompt is also mapped to a marketing funnel stage:

        - TOFU (Top of Funnel): Awareness queries, usually broad and educational.

        - MOFU (Middle of Funnel): Consideration queries, often involving comparisons or research.

        - BOFU (Bottom of Funnel): Decision-stage queries, often including pricing, implementation, or product-specific needs.

    - Funnel mapping helps you understand whether your brand is showing up at the right stages to influence buyers throughout their journey.
