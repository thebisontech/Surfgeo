# Tags & Funnel mapping (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU)

Strategic prompt organization through **tags and funnel mapping** enables **sophisticated analysis and targeted optimization campaigns**.

Instead of treating all prompts the same, this system helps you group them by intent, topic, and funnel stage — giving you a clear view of where your brand is strong and where it needs improvement.

## Intent-Based Tagging System

- Every prompt is automatically classified by **user intent** using advanced NLP.

- **Categories:**
  - **Informational:** Users want knowledge or explanations.

    - Example: “how does GEO work”

    - Focus here is on educating the user and positioning your brand as an expert.

  - **Commercial:** Users are comparing options before making a decision.

    - Example: “best GEO platforms”

    - This is a key stage to stand out against competitors.

  - **Navigational:** Users are looking for a specific resource or brand page.

    - Example: “Surfgeo documentation”

    - These queries show brand recognition and intent to find your material directly.

  - **Transactional:** Users are ready to buy or take action.

    - Example: “Surfgeo pricing plans”

    - These are high-value prompts that directly tie to conversions


## Topic Cluster Organization

- Prompts are grouped into **topic clusters** for alignment with **content strategy**.
- Platform uses **semantic analysis** to detect relationships.
- **Cluster types:**
  - **Primary clusters** → core topics.
  - **Secondary clusters** → related subtopics.
- Example: a **"GEO Strategy"** cluster may include prompts about **implementation, measurement, and optimization**.
- An **interactive network diagram** visualizes **cluster relationships** and **connection strength**.

## TOFU / MOFU / BOFU Funnel Mapping

Prompts are also aligned with **marketing funnel stages** to ensure you cover the full buyer journey.
This helps you see whether you’re reaching people at the awareness stage, winning during comparisons, and converting at the decision stage.

- **TOFU (Top of Funnel)**
  - Represents the awareness stage with broad, educational queries.

  - Example: “What is GEO?”

  - Best for building visibility and introducing your brand.

  - Track metrics like reach and brand introduction rate.

- **MOFU (Middle of Funnel)**
  - Represents the consideration stage where users compare solutions and research features.

  - Example: “Surfgeo vs other GEO platforms”

  - Important for standing out in competitive comparisons.

  - Monitor competitive win rate and feature mention accuracy.

- **BOFU (Bottom of Funnel)**
  - Represents the decision stage, where users are ready to choose a product or service.

  - Example: “Surfgeo pricing plans” or “Surfgeo setup guide”

  - These are high-intent queries with strong conversion potential.

  - Focus on conversion influence and exclusive mention rate (being the only brand mentioned).
