# 3.1 Company Profile and Brand Domains (How to add, alias rules)

Your journey with Surfgeo begins with establishing your company profile and brand domains. This foundational setup determines what the platform tracks and how it identifies your brand across LLM responses.

**Setting Up Your Primary Domain:**
- Navigate to the onboarding and enter your primary domain (e.g., surfgeo.com).
- This domain serves as your brand's primary identifier.
- The system automatically validates the domain to ensure it's accessible and properly configured.
- You'll see a green checkmark once validation completes successfully.
