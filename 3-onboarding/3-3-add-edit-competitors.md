## Add / Edit Competitors

Competitive tracking forms the backbone of your GEO strategy. Surfgeo's competitor management system allows nuanced tracking of your competitive landscape.

**AI Pre-Filled Competitor Suggestions**: The system will automatically suggest 5 competitors based on your industry and service settings.
- Review these suggestions and accept, edit, or delete as needed.
- You can add additional competitors manually if they are not included in the suggestions.

## Adding Competitors

- Click "Add Competitor" and enter the competitor's primary domain. The system performs several validation checks:
  - Domain accessibility and validity (delete if the competitor is offline)
  - Duplicate detection against existing competitors (delete duplicates automatically)
  - Industry relevance scoring (delete if not relevant to your primary industry)

- For each competitor, provide:
  - **Company Name**: Official business name
